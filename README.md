The tool is marketed as offering a lifetime package and access to a HvH (Hack versus Hack) server. However, it is important to note that Nevermiss has garnered a controversial reputation within the Roblox community due to the owner's shady background and uncertainty surrounding the safety measures implemented in the tool.
